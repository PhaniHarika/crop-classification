# Crop Classification Data Analysis and Preprocessing

This project demonstrates Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data cleaning, feature engineering, and preprocessing techniques applied to a crop dataset. The goal is to prepare data for crop classification machine learning models following the CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology.

üìÇ Files Included

Crop Classification Data Analysis and Preprocessing.py

Python script containing code for data analysis, visualization, and preprocessing.

crop.csv.xlsx

Dataset with features such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), Temperature, Humidity, pH, Rainfall, and crop labels.

‚öôÔ∏è Steps Covered in the Project
